# IPFS-RingDHT
This repository hosts the implementation of an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) using a Ring Distributed Hash Table (DHT) in C++. The project utilizes the Chord protocol to create a robust and fault-tolerant distributed file storage and retrieval system. 

Used BTrees to store keys and BIGINT to store big numbers. Hashing algorithm is SHA
